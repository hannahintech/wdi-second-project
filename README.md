# wdi-second-project


# The brief: 
  * consolidate new knowledge of databases, by creating models which include at least one referenced model and one embedded model. The project must include user authentication and the ability to log in and interact with the data. We had to use mongo and ejs, and remember restful routing and crud principles. 


# my idea: 
  * My original aim was to create something fun and simple. I felt that it would be fun to create an app that creates a randomly generated outfit when you press a button. 
  * However, to be able to do that, I would first need to be able to create a model for the items used in the outfits, and then create the outfits, as well as including the ability to log in as a user. 
  * Since all the tech I was using was new to me, that was a step too deep, so I scaled it back and created a user interface which allowed the user to add items of clothing and view them. I also got to the point of creating an outfit, but it wasn't random.

I struggled a bit to stick to a clear vision considering I was sort of building something that was a workaround of my original concept. However, I attempted to resolve the user journeys and plan out the app in a way that fitted with the new concept - being able to add items and create outfits which could be edited or added to favourites. Following from this, there was a missing link in the idea where you should be able to create an outfit from individual items when viewing an item, yet I didn't get to that point. 

The real challenge I had with this project was trying to create something based around what I could actually achieve, technically speaking, and achieve well, in the time frame given (one week).

I felt I learnt most from the fact I ended up with a product that felt a little patchwork and clunky from the user perspective. I felt it gave me a better understanding of how long I take to complete things, at least when they are fairly new, and also how important it is to consider the technical debt of the idea you want to use. 

I was proud of how much I managed to learn during the week, and of how comfortable I became accessing data from the database at various levels of depth (so, for example, a user referenced by an item, which had been added to an outfit).

# plan for next steps:
  * I need to try and create a more seamless user experience and fill in the gaps which my patchwork planning left. (such as adding an item to an outfit from the individual item page). 
  * I would like to add an api for the weather (which was in my original plan; an app that generates an outfit based on the weather forecast).
  * I would also like to clean up my scss. a small detail which is particularly bothering me is the desire to change my homepage buttons to be cards with image prompts, to give the site a more professional feel.
